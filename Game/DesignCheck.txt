For our minimax procedure:

It'll use legal moves, game status, estimate_value, next_state

1. for example the root list, then run through a tree for each
legal move using estimate_value to predict

2. If there are no legal moves available there will be a draw, and that
only occurs if the board is full and its the AIs turn

3. The AI will assume that the other player is trying to make them lose,
therefore AI assumes the other player will play perfectly

First priority is make connect four if there are 3 in a row
Second priority is block 4 if there is one
Third priority is set up win
Fourth priority is prevent other player from setting up

*Make list of priorities

AI will always assume that the other person plays perfectly therefore
it makes its moves based on that

Should work against AI or human

Player will input Move of number, then it'll turn that into a move
If they provide invalid input, provide failwith. Ask for another move
Implement a trywith or raise exception if there is an out of bounds move

Explanation for how referee works:
prints current game state
Then matches that with win, draw, ongoing and prints that
If win or draw, end
else for ongoing print who's turn it is
Then prompt other player for move
Print the move they make
Failure otherwise
Then loop

Print the game
Prompt players to move
Keep track of who has won

NOTE THAT
