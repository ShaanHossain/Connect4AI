(* NOTE there will be a procedure that takes in the move as one argument and
the other argument will be the state of the game, and the other output will
be what is the result of dropping that connect 4 piece in that column *)

(* NOTE we should represent a non value as an option or a number *)

(* NOTE represent each list a column *)

(* NOTE don't 0 index if we want tournament *)

(* NOTE check tiles in diagonal *)

(* Add 0 spots so that we could align any diagonal into a row *)

Questions for TA:

Can we check_expects constructs_board instead of initial_state
-> as initial_state doesn't take in any arguments

NOTE one check_expect for whatever our rows and columns are

Ask about paralegal and the problem we came across

Ask about progress so far and optimization on estimate_value for columns
- Go to diagonal
